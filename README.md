# Snip 'n' Sketch Tool 
Automatically convert a single page of maths textbook questions into individual images for each question.

I created this tool as my school teachers were spending many hours manually cropping questions from our textbook, so that each question was saved an individual image (the required format us to complete the work correctly). My program automate this process using _OpenCV_ and _Python-tesseract_ to identify the coordinates of each question on the page and crop the image accordingly.
